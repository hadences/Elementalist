## 🚀 Description
This is a retro-style game built using Unity. After intensive coding from ProjectJJK, I figured I come back to game dev - starting with a simple project.
Elementalist is a game inspired by Breakout, but with a spinoff - you can only break the blocks by either with the same element, or with their weak element.

## 🎯 Features
- Modular/Structured System (SoundManager, GameManager, etc...)
- 8x8 Pixel art style
- Arcade like game.

## 🛠 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hadences/Elementalist.git
cd Elementalist
